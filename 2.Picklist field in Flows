Q) What are the different ways we can create picklist values in Flows?
A) 3 ways
      i.Manually create our own picklist values - Choices
              Ex: Yes/No
      ii. Get Picklist values from Different Object (standard/Custom Object). - Picklist Choice Set

      Note: We can use both Picklist and Multi-Select picklist values.
     
      iii.Get text type datatype values of a field as picklist values for a picklist field -Collection Choice Set.
            Ex: For example I have an Opportunity Name field on the screen, and I need one picklist field and the values in that picklist fields should be All Account Name feild values.

Note: we can also get picklist values from an object and display the fields in the flow as Radio buttons as well.
